                            A Six Sigma Black Belt project reduced the defect rate of the LS-331C stamped automotive part from 8% to 
                            below 1% in 3 months. By addressing cracks and splits through root cause analysis and process improvements, 
                            customer complaints and financial losses were minimized. The project achieved a process capability of 
                            Cpk = 1.45.
